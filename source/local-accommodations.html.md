# Local Accommodations

For parents, family or commuting campers, there are ample accommodations in the
local area that camp be secured by visiting one of the following websites.

* [Eugene Chamber of Commerce](http://www.eugenechamber.com/)
* [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=hotel+eugene,+oregon&ie=UTF8&z=14&om=1)
* [Hotels.com](http://www.hotels.com/)

We're sorry, but we are unable to provide on-campus housing to anyone other than
participating campers, and only then for the dates that camp is in session.
