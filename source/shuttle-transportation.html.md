## Parking On Campus

For individuals who choose to drive their own cars to camp (whether you are a
day or an overnight camper), you are encouraged to purchase a parking permit at
check-in on the first day of camp.

If you choose to not purchase a pass, please be advised that Public Safety
_will_ issue parking tickets which will be the sole responsibility of the
owner of the offending vehicle.
