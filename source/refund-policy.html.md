# Refund Policy

In the event of a cancellation (personal or medical), we will refund all
deposits made minus a $30 administrative fee, and any online registration fees.
All requests for refunds must be made in writing (email is OK), and must be
submitted within 7 days of the end of camp.

__Refunds will not be processed until August 15, 2014.__

_Checks returned NSF (non sufficient funds) will be assessed a $30 bank fee.
Non-payment of an NSF check is a violation of NCAA regulations (reduced
admission)._
